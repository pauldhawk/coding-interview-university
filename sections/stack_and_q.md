- ### Stack
    - [ ] [Stacks (video)](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/data-structures/stacks-UdKzQ)
    - [ ] Will not implement. Implementing with array is trivial

- ### Queue
    - [ ] [Queue (video)](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/data-structures/queues-EShpq)
    - [ ] [Circular buffer/FIFO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_buffer)
    - [ ] Implement using linked-list, with tail pointer:
        - enqueue(value) - adds value at position at tail
        - dequeue() - returns value and removes least recently added element (front)
        - empty()
    - [ ] Implement using fixed-sized array:
        - enqueue(value) - adds item at end of available storage
        - dequeue() - returns value and removes least recently added element
        - empty()
        - full()
    - [ ] Cost:
        - a bad implementation using linked list where you enqueue at head and dequeue at tail would be O(n)
            because you'd need the next to last element, causing a full traversal each dequeue
        - enqueue: O(1) (amortized, linked list and array [probing])
        - dequeue: O(1) (linked list and array)
        - empty: O(1) (linked list and array)
